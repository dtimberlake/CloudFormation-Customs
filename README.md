# Introduction

CFCustoms is a helper library for building AWS CloudFormation custom resources. When using this library you only need to write the provisioning logic for your custom resource and let CFCustoms handle the individual request routing and responses.


**Note**: This library is a work in progress, probably doesn't work yet, and shouldn't be used in a production setting.
